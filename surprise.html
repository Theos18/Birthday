Suri, there is no word as unfortunate when Drashti is my PARTNER my WIFE.

Wishing you a very very Happy Delightful and Memorable Birthday my love. 

I'm thankful to god that he gave me a complete package. But this sentence doesn't even come remotely close of hwo important you are to me , in terms of my favorite anime, you are Ichimonji of my Zoro, you are Grin of my Bakugo, you are Goal of my Isagi, I'm 100% sure you didn't understand a single thing of what they are - {even when I told you to watch anime with me} but ech toh che - tara par gusso nai kari sakto but hehe satavi toh sakuchu etle no letter directly - I have set up a time where each word will come up after 0.5 seconds only, 1 minute mukwu tu but Prem che maaru tu kyare hairan nathi karwu kyare dukh nathi pochawu kyare kaich aavi vastu nai karwu jenathi tane dukh thaaye. 

The only thing I ever want to do with my life is to keep you happy is to make you smile is to make you proud jenathi everyday you wake up will be the best day of your life. And uske liye I promise - I'll do everything in my power. Most importantly PROPER GUJRATI sikhis ha, even though I speak Gujrati onli. Bleh.

But I love you so so so muchhhh, above all the roles you are playing - BestFriend, Wife, CrimePartner, Mishti ni Mummy, Saas ki Bahu etc etc you will always be my Drashtudii first.

Wishing you a blast-ful Birthday maari Dakuu.
